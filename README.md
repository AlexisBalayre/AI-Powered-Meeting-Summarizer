# AI-Powered Meeting Summarizer

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Meeting Summarizer** is a Gradio-powered application that converts audio recordings of meetings into transcripts and provides concise summaries using `whisper.cpp` for audio-to-text conversion and `Ollama` for text summarization. This tool is ideal for quickly extracting key points, decisions, and action items from meetings.

## Features

- **Audio-to-Text Conversion**: Uses `whisper.cpp` to convert audio files into text.
- **Text Summarization**: Uses models from the `Ollama` server to summarize the transcript.
- **Multiple Models Support**: Supports different Whisper models (`base`, `small`, `medium`, `large-V3`) and any available model from the Ollama server.
- **Translation**: Allows translation of non-English audio to English using Whisper.
- **Gradio Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface to upload audio files, view summaries, and download transcripts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (for audio processing)
- [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) (for audio-to-text conversion)
- [Ollama server](https://ollama.com/) (for text summarization)
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) (for the web interface)
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (for handling API calls to the Ollama server)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexisBalayre/AI-Powered-Meeting-Summarizer
cd AI-Powered-Meeting-Summarizer
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

To install all necessary dependencies (including Python virtual environment, `whisper.cpp`, FFmpeg, and Python packages), and to run the application, execute the provided setup script:

```bash
chmod +x run_meeting_summarizer.sh
./run_meeting_summarizer.sh
```

This script will:

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
- Install necessary Python packages like `requests` and `gradio`.
- Check if `FFmpeg` is installed and install it if missing.
- Clone and build `whisper.cpp`.
- Download the required Whisper model (default: `small`).
- **Run the `main.py` script**, which will start the Gradio interface for the application.

### Step 3: Accessing the Application

Once the setup and execution are complete, Gradio will provide a URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). Open this URL in your web browser to access the Meeting Summarizer interface.

Alternatively, after setup, you can activate the virtual environment and run the Python script manually:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the main.py script
python main.py
```

## Usage

### Uploading an Audio File

1. **Upload an Audio File**: Click on the audio upload area and select an audio file in any supported format (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`).
2. **Provide Context (Optional)**: You can provide additional context for better summarization (e.g., "Meeting about AI and Ethics").
3. **Select Whisper Model**: Choose one of the available Whisper models (`base`, `small`, `medium`, `large-V3`) for audio-to-text conversion.
4. **Select Summarization Model**: Choose a model from the available options retrieved from the `Ollama` server.

### Viewing Results

- After uploading an audio file, you will get a **Summary** of the transcript generated by the selected models.
- You can also **download the full transcript** as a text file by clicking the provided link.

## Customization

### Changing the Whisper Model

By default, the Whisper model used is `small`. You can modify this in the `run_meeting_summarizer.sh` script by changing the `WHISPER_MODEL` variable:

```bash
WHISPER_MODEL="medium"
```

Alternatively, you can select different Whisper models from the dropdown in the Gradio interface. The list of available models is dynamically generated based on the `.bin` files found in the `whisper.cpp/models` directory.

### Downloading Additional Whisper Models

To download a different Whisper model (e.g., `base`, `medium`, `large`), use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `whisper.cpp` directory:

   ```bash
   cd whisper.cpp
   ```

2. Use the provided script to download the desired model. For example, to download the `base` model, run:

   ```bash
   ./models/download-ggml-model.sh base
   ```

   For the `large` model, you can run:

   ```bash
   ./models/download-ggml-model.sh large
   ```

   This will download the `.bin` file into the `whisper.cpp/models` directory.

3. Once downloaded, the new model will automatically be available in the model dropdown when you restart the application.

### Configuring Translation

By default, Whisper will detect the language of the audio file and translate it to English if necessary. This behavior is controlled by the `-l` flag in the `whisper.cpp` command.

```bash
./whisper.cpp/main -m ./whisper.cpp/models/ggml-{WHISPER_MODEL}.bin -l fr -f "{audio_file_wav}"
```

This flag tells Whisper to translate the audio into French regardless of the original language.
